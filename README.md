# 🐍 100 Days of Code – Python

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge focused on Python!  
This repository is where I’ll track my progress, share projects, and document everything I learn throughout this journey.

## 📅 About the Challenge

The #100DaysOfCode challenge is all about building the habit of coding every day.  
For the next 100 days, I’ll spend at least one hour daily working with Python and commit my code here.

## 🚀 Goals

- Improve Python skills by consistent daily practice
- Explore basic to advanced Python concepts
- Build real-world mini-projects and scripts
- Learn and use popular libraries like `requests`, `pandas`, `flask`, and more
